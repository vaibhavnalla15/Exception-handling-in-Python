""" Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a number and handles a KeyboardInterrupt exception if the user cancels the input. """

# exception KeyboardInterrupt:
# Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (normally Control-C or Delete). During execution, a check for interrupts is made regularly. The exception inherits from BaseException so as to not be accidentally caught by code that catches Exception and thus prevent the interpreter from exiting.

try:
    n = int(input("Enter a number:- "))
    print(n)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Input cancelled by user")
